# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Machine learning – DEEPCRAFT&trade; deploy vision

This code example demonstrates a real-time hand gesture detection that uses a USB camera to capture live video and a DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio object detection model to detect hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) in the video feed using ModusToolbox&trade;. The detected gestures are highlighted by drawing a bounding box around the gesture and displaying the corresponding text (rock, paper, or scissors) in a text box on the display and on a terminal.

This code example has a three-project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position

  - [OV7675 0.3MP DVP Camera module](https://blog.arducam.com/products/camera-breakout-board/0-3mp-ov7675) <br>

> **Note:** For any USB camera other than the ones listed above, ensure that the vendor ID  and product ID of the camera being used are correctly configured in the *usb_camera_task.c* and *usb_camera_task.h* file.

- **Waveshare 4.3 inch Raspberry Pi DSI 800 x 480 display:** <br>
  Connect the FPC 15-pin cable between the display connector and the PSOC&trade; Edge E84's RPI MIPI DSI connector as outlined in **Table 1** and **Figure 1**

   **Table 1. Cable connection between display connect and kit**

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

Install the [ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning Pack](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.modustoolboxpackmachinelearning) or use the [Infineon Developer Center (IDC)](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/utilities/infineon-developer-center-idc-launcher/) launcher and search for "ModusToolbox Machine Learning Pack" and install it.

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Connect the USB camera to the kit's USB host port and display as mentioned in the [Supported camera and display](#supported-camera-and-display) section

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: Machine learning DEEPCRAFT deploy vision" is displayed on the UART terminal and the kit will start capturing video from the USB camera
